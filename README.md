# LC Shovel Bonk
Replaces the normal shovel swing sound with BONK.

## BepInEx Install
Merge the plugins folder from [latest release](http://www.github.com/Oni-Hazza/ShovelBonk/releases/latest) with the `BepInEx/plugins` folder.

As long as the file name in `BepInEx/plugins/ShovelSound` is called `bonk.wav` you can basically replace it with whichever sound you want.
